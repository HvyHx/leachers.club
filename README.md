# was easy because it was just to explain a gaming idea, that I'm going to grow off of.
# cyberia.is was used for obvious reasons, check them out.

#The first ever creation of this app, I'm doing with barely any coding knowledge.
# -create shortcut file to leachers.club's github.
# -create a torrent that shares the shortcut & my map for future releases.
# -created a magnet link for easy transfer (avoiding censorship is some cases) also as an art project I am going to spread these links around on NFC stickers.
